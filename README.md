# Ionic and Firebase Starter Template

The goal for this app is to work as a starting point for someone using Ionic and Firebase to build their projects.

It will showcase:

* User Authentication.
* CRUD.
* Firebase Storage.
* Offline Support.
* Push Notifications.
* Firebase Cloud Functions
* ... and more in the future.

I still have a lot to figure out in terms of how I'm going to handle this, but it's going to be open source and I'm thinking MIT licenced.
